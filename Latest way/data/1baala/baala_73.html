  <p class="comment">
   Is this entry of this maternal uncle of Bharata a forced one or does this have any bearing on the flow of epic... is a doubt, 
though not a question. Further he is saying 'my sister's son' i.e., Bharata alone, instead of 'all my nephews...' Whether 
this episode has a bearing on future events or not, one
   <em>
    maama
   </em>
   is entered in Indian epics, like this one and
   <em>
    Shakuni maama

   He arrived at the Vedic-ritual hall that he was frequenting for the last few days. Unless invited the bridegroom's party 
will not enter the marriage hall, and nowadays such an invitation includes a small function also, called
   <em>

the marriage and, all have thread-bands tied around their wrists, as they all have performed an auspicious ceremony antecedent 
to marriage ceremony. [1-73-9, 10a]
  </p>
  <p class="comment">
   The ceremony for the marriage thread, the sacred thread of marriage for knotting as a necklace of the bride,
   <em>
    mangala- 
suutra
   </em>
   is nowadays mixed up with
   <em>
    gauri-puuja
   </em>
   , and this
   <em>
    gauri-puuja
   </em>
   took precedence of that ceremony, 
because
   <em>
    gauri-puuja,
   </em>
   took its roots in the auxiliary Ramayana-s, where Seetha is said to have gone to Goddess 
Parvati's temple, prior to her marriage, to perform
   <em>
    gauri-puuja
   </em>
   , pledging herself to Rama. The thread bands tied 
at the wrists of both the bride and bridegroom is as per wedding time vows, to bring them under the pledge of marriage, 
until its consummation. Indian marriages are time-oriented and every function has to happen on the appointed hour. Hence, 
the arrival of bridegrooms is also on an opportune hour, which astrologically brings forth success of that event. But some 
say that this auspicious hour Vijaya occurs in the early part of the day, where this marriage is occurring in the later 
part of day, hence this time is to be reckoned as one that acquires some victory later in the epic.
  </p>
  <p class="comment">
   Brides are not the lone category of people destined to wear jewellery. But bridegrooms are also asked to wear golden ornaments, 
at least one, on such occasions. The metal gold is said to contain some effect by which a man or a woman will be benefited, 
health wise:
   <em>
    mR^itaa durluptam madhumat suvarNam dhanam jananam ruNam daarayiSunam...
   </em>

   These are neither questions nor surprises, but the usual retorts and repartees usually employed during wedding time by both 
parties,
   <em>
    sandhi-s
   </em>
   of northerners and
   <em>

Altar of Fire in the midpoint of the cool-thatched manorial-marriage-shed, decorating it with sandal paste and flowers. 
Then he promptly sanctified variously coloured handy vessels, and lid-like concave earthen vessels, which are full with 
just sprouted sprigs, and he sanctified even other golden vessels, censers with fumes of incenses, conch-shell like vessels, 
and short handled wooden scoops for scooping oblatory items from vessels for putting it in long-handled scoops, and long-handled 
wooden scoops to drop those oblatory items into Ritual-fire, and vessels filled with oblatory items like ghee, water, milk 
etc., and vessels filled with toasted rice-flakes and vessels filled with holy yellow-rice duly treated with turmeric, and 
he sanctified all articles of wedding ceremony by sprinkling holy-yellow-rice, as a kind of dry-ablution. [1-73-19b, 20,

    </p>
    <p class="comment">
     These are some of the usual paraphernalia for marriage ceremony even now. The sprouting sprigs are symbolic for the prospective 
sprigs from this marriage, and rice-flakes for the abundance of livelihood of the couple. Usually the concave lid like vessels 
will be filled with black cotton soil, and on them nine varieties of grain
     <em>
      navadhaanya
     </em>
     will be sprinkled to obtain 
sprigs. Later they are to be kept sacred for some days, watering daily, and then can be implanted in earth, if they survive. 
There are hosts of shops specialised to sell these items and the shopkeeper firstly asks for information 'for bride's side 
or for bridegroom's side?' And if we say, 'we are from bride's side' a long-list is presented, [while bridegroom's side 
will have a shorter list of items,] and then the shopkeeper mercifully asks 'how much is the dowry?' If we say this much 
or that much, he will present a Victorian model push-close pull-open velvet bag. If we exclaim 'what for is this, priest 
has not listed this' then he politely says, 'the priests of these days are unaware of customs and the dowry is to be put 
in that velvet bag and then given, as a royal presentation...' And if we say 'we are drained out by the dowry, wherefrom 
we give royal presentations...' then he will spew fire on us saying 'you spend so much on dowry, can't you purchase its 
velvet bag...' and thereafter a sermon follows about the dying Indian culture at the onslaught of westernisation, while 
he starts throwing the packets of
     <em>
      navadhaanya
     </em>
     etc., as though he is giving alms to the beggar. Though Janaka has 
not purchased such a bag of dowry, he has some more problems with this marriage. A discussion on this is there at later 
part. Here the sprouted sprigs are the sprouting avengers on the evil, called Ravana.

    <p class="comment">
     By the way, where is this Kausalya? Does Rama enrich her happiness without bringing her to his marriage? We have not heard 
of her or of other queens or hosts of his other wives, for the last three, four days. Has she come, at all? - Yes, she has 
come and she is physically present - is the argument of some, basing on Valmiki's style of unrecorded accounts on trivial, 
or matter of fact scenes. They are implied and implicit. Dasharatha has performed some cow donations, religious functions 
etc., which he is not supposed to do without his wife at his side. These ladies are implicitly included in the first verse 
of sixty-ninth chapter:
     <em>
      sopaadhyaayaH sabaandhavaH
     </em>
     'with teachers, with relatives...' and Dasharatha has no 
near relatives, not exactly relatives, but family, other than his queens and sons. So, they all are in 'et cetera... and 
others' cadre at present. Other way round, it is said in Kshatriya-s only male members will go and get the bride, which 
has no reasonable or tenable import, as far as marriages are concerned, and where every marriage concerns only with womenfolk 
and their panoply.
    </p>
    <p class="comment">
     Seetha is said to have all bridal jewellery, which is not odd or particular to this corner of globe. But it is oddish and 
exotic jewellery if the bride is from well-to-do family or from royal family. Though not all, some of the jewellery items 
that are almost extinct now are listed here.

     Here there are five Raghava-s and only one
     <em>
      kausalyaanandavardhana
     </em>
     i.e., Rama. Then poet should have simply said 
'Rama' instead of 'Raghava' but there are many Rama-s, Parashu Rama, and Bala Rama and suchlike, and on such calling as 
'Rama...' Parashu Rama, who is scheduled to enter after marriage, may perhaps enter now, in a faux pas. Then the poet should 
have said
     <em>
      dasharathaatmajam
     </em>
     . Then, who will be that single soul from among the four boys of Dasharatha to come 
forward. And if all the four hear the calling, as 'oh, Raghava' all will reply in chorus "ok, it is I..." then what will 
happen? Avoiding all these irksome situations, the poet gave this stage-direction to Janaka that he should aim at the son 
of Kausalya, with a subtext, 'you are mothered by some human female, whereas my daughter is motherless, rather un-mothered,
     <em>
      ayonijaa
     </em>
     non-foetal is her origination, hence it is apt of you to not to belittle her, anytime and anywhere... 
and you have to keep faith with her, since she outshines in outperforming your task in this so-called incarnation...'

     The above is very a convenient and readymade gist of that verse. But the three pronouns in the first stanza
     <em>
      iyam, mama, 
tava
     </em>
     'this, mine, yours' are supposed to play havoc in deciphering the latent meaning of this verse. Let us look at 
some of them.
    </p>
    <p class="tat">
     Seetha is very much there in the front of Rama, and Janaka might have shown her and told "take her...' Why this
     <em>
      iyam
     </em>
     i.e., "this" It is explained as below:
    </p>
    <p class="tat">
     Janaka: This and this alone is Seetha, the unique, exceptional and earmarked one for you... do not confuse yourself by looking 
at Urmila, Maandavi and Shrutakiirti they are for your brothers
    </p>
    <p class="tat">
     Rama: Why she alone is earmarked for me?
    </p>
    <p class="tat">
     Janaka: Because she is 'Seetha '
    </p>
    <p class="tat">
     Rama: What, you mean a furrow, or a sillion...
    </p>
    <p class="tat">
     [Sillion is an old word for furrow, not found in dictionaries, but used by poet Hopkins in his 'The Windhover' sheer plod 
makes plough down sillion /]
    </p>
    <p class="tat">
     Janaka: Yes, everything comes out of earth... from coal to gold, flora to fauna, rivers to ridges everything.... a morsel 
of food comes from a handful of mud in this mortal world.... your being, becoming and belonging in, are manifest only because 
of that earth and earth enables you to live on her without seeking any requital or reciprocation and earth is the symbol 
of enduing toleration, though you dig, dung or dredge it.... hence, Seetha is the symbol for mortal truth, and mortally 
tolerant womanhood and you people want to know the Unknown in the skies, but do not wish to know what that is right under 
your feet...

     if the Supreme Person beyond 
darkness is knowable, and sages like Vishvamitra know you and tell that you are some Super Soul

      iyam siitaa,

     for she is somebody to match you... 
have you not mugged up Veda-s, Upanishad-s

     <u>
      Adi Shankara's commentary

     : There are three letters that denote the Absolute

     ; and the syllable

      ii

     on
     <em>
      sat
     </em>

     </em>
     indicates immortality and the word
     <em>
      ta
     </em>
     mortality, and the syllable
     <em>
      yam

      Ramanuja comment:

     The letter
     <em>
      sat
     </em>
     is immortality and the letter
     <em>

     is mortality and

     yet to be delivered bounded souls;

     both the delivered and bounded souls.
    </p>
    <p class="tat">
     Janaka: Seetha is that
     <em>
      yam
     </em>
     the conjunctive, conditioner, bridge between the mortal and immortal,
     <em>
      setu - eSa 
setu iti vidhaaraNaa
     </em>
     the presiding deity of
     <em>
      cetana-acetana
     </em>
     dynamic, static beings. oh, Rama, it is said in Vishnu 
Puraana that Seetha is your lookalike, minus your sky-blue complexion,
     <em>
      raaghavatve bhavet siitaa...
     </em>
     It is said 
in yet another scripture,
     <em>
      yathaa mayaa jagat vyaaptam - svaruupeNa svabhaavataH | tayaa vyaaptam idam vishvam niyantrii 
ca tathaa iishvarii ||
     </em>
     'as to how I am all pervading, likewise She, Goddess Lakshmi, is all pervading and the controller 
of the universe ' and if you want to establish yourself as the protector of this world, you have to take this and this Seetha 
alone, as she is the cause for the desired effect of yours and, she is from Mother Earth
     <em>
      ratna-garbhaa
     </em>
     and you are 
a sapphirine boy from a mother, and a sapphire shines only if it is studded in earth-given gold
     <em>
      anargham api maaNikyam 
hemaashrayam apekShate
     </em>
     otherwise you, your incarnation, your epic, your mission, why one or two, everything concerning 
you will be futile, and you have to return to your milky abode empty handed, and here on earth, every house breeds one or 
more Ravana-s
    </p>
    <p class="tat">
     Rama: How am I to conclude 'this' as 'that...' I mean Goddess Lakshmi
    </p>
    <p class="tat">
     Janaka: Certain aspects are to be inferred because they are unmanifest. Fire on the mountain is unmanifest but smoke is 
manifest, hence fire is inferred. So also,
     <em>
      ayam iishvarii
     </em>
     is manifest as
     <em>
      iyam
     </em>
     this girl... from
     <em>
      siitaa
     </em>
     furrow, sillion, a narrow trench in ground made by ploughshare... as a small seed manifests into a gigantic banyan tree, 
and from this the nature of her non-foetal birth, it is to be inferred likewise, and only because of it she is someone above 
mortals. Because you have come as a mortal she has to take birth as a mortal, as an inseparable entity of yours
    </p>
    <p class="tat">
     Rama: Then why can't she fall from sky or from other planet?
    </p>
    <p class="tat">
     Janaka: She cannot. Your connection with this earth is age-old and you love it. Because you love earth, she has to emerge 
from earth, a lovely act for you.
    </p>
    <p class="tat">
     Rama: Then why
     <em>
      mama sutaa...
     </em>
     she can be fostered in any orphanage
    </p>
    <p class="tat">
     Janaka: Not so. An auspicious thing or being requires a sanctum sanctorum... Mithila is one such... and Videha-s are not 
just kings of this part of land, but they are priests of pious or holy things like the bow of Shiva. You know the naming 
of
     <em>
      vi-deha...
     </em>
     it is not 'without bodies...' but transcending bodily affairs Thus she chose this as her background 
and as she presented herself to me as baby girl, I have look upon her as
     <em>
      mama sutaa
     </em>
     'my daughter ' And many, many 
kings sought her hand in marriage, but I refused and they warred with me, whereby I had to call for the forces of gods to 
counterattack the enemy forces; perhaps, you might not have heard that humans can summon gods; thus gods are at my disposal; 
a prayer of mine brings them here, either for a war or for a ritual So, do not take me or my daughter Seetha,
     <em>
      iyam siitaa 
mama sutaa
     </em>
     as some ignoramus and insignificant dullards
    </p>
    <p class="tat">
     Rama: Then why you want me to take back, as though she belonged to me for eons, but lost in a journey
    </p>
    <p class="tat">
     Janaka: Yes, she is yours from ages unknown; I cannot donate her in
     <em>
      kanyaa-daana
     </em>
     'bestowal of bride ' because your 
marriage is eternal. But you two have arrived here in human forms, so conduct yourselves in conformity with human customs.... 
that is why I tell
     <em>
      pratiicCha enaaam
     </em>
     ' take her back, wishfully ' for that saying of mine get no anger on me;
     <em>
      bhadram te
     </em>
     'let safeness betide' you; by this act of yours
     <em>
      paaNim gR^ihNiSva paaNinaa
     </em>
     ' you take her palm 
into your palm ' that which is customary in human
     <em>
      paaNigrahaNa-mahotsava
     </em>
     'wedding ceremony '; by the way, you 
always keep your consort in your heart
     <em>
      hR^idaya kamala
     </em>
     do not do such things as long as you are on earth for your 
incarnation will be disclosed.... just take her hand and let not this heavenly discourse be leaked out... lest Ravana may 
come to know that you are not human and it will be impossible for you to eliminate that evil, thereby
    </p>
    <p class="comment">
     Likewise, let us, the readers of rAmAyaNa, keep this info about Rama undisclosed to Ravana, if any of us meet Ravana by 
chance....

in Mithila....

     Rama: No, No, No, you are wrong... I did not aim at any girl when aiming to lift that old bow... sorry for your unilateral 
conclusion...
    </p>
    <p class="tat">
     Janaka: No, my dear boy, the condition I stipulated before your touching that bow is bilateral... I clearly said that my 
daughter belongs to one who can lift that bow... you were quick enough to grab the girl, rather than the bow... and in that 
hastiness you even broke that bow... had you declined the girl, you should have declined to lift the bow, also... so,
     <em>
      iyam siita

     was the only intention of yours when lifting that bow...

    </p>
    <p class="tat">
     Janaka: You seem to be a doubting Thomas... that's why I said
     <em>

why your guru Vishvamitra brought you here, that too by foot don't think that you are taking this girl for your personal

    <p class="comment">
     What happened to these gods when boyish Rama eliminated Tataka and others? Are they any lesser feats than this marriage? 
And why this drumming and showering flowers and blessings, when it is 'just' a human's marriage? Now the cause for the effect 
is conjoined to Rama to effectuate their plea to Brahma. If the entire arsenal given by Vishvamitra is set-aside for a moment, 
the 'present' now presented by Janaka is the ultimate weapon for the use against Ravana.
     <em>
      aprameyam hi tat tejo yasya 
saa janakaatmajaa
     </em>
     'unlimited is the energy, to whom Janaka's daughter belongs...' Rama is the instrumental cause 
in eliminating Ravana, whereas Seetha is the efficient cause for it. Lanka is ruined by Seetha, through Hanuma with the 
help of Fire-god, but not by Rama, or all of the monkeys put together. And Rama eliminates the half-dead Ravana. There are 
some more flower-showers and drumbeats and dances, later.

     All the four bridegrooms are palminpalmed with all the four brides, paying heed to Janaka's words, and abiding in Vashishta's 
orchestration of Vedic hymns and procedures. [1-73-34b, 35a]
    </p>
    <p class="comment">
     The word 'palminpalmed' may look oddish, but it is in fashion with the verb 'arminarmed' invented by poet Roger McGhou.

    </p>
    <p class="comment">
     Firstly Vashishta enkindled the holy fire and offered oblations in it for the wellbeing of Rama and his brothers, say the 
bridegrooms. Next, another round of enkindling of holy fire took place in which Rama and brothers have offered marriage 
time oblations. After accepting the palms of brides, they made circumambulations, and then each couple established its own 
ritual fire and offered oblations into it. Then each couple had oblated rice-flakes into the fire, and again performed circumambulations 
to that Ritual-fire, respectively. Thus, the marriage is not a handshake like one-minute affair, as they all shall be before 
fire, daylong.
