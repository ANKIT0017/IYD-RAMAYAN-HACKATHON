  <p class="txt">
   Khara provokes Rama to fight, but Rama gives enough advise to Khara to yield up. Khara presumes that 
Rama is overtired to fight him back and thus enters into verbal fight. Ultimately Khara hurls a mammoth 
mace at Rama, which burns down all the neighbouring plants and bushes, and Rama splinters it down while 
it is still sky rocketing.

   Rama is said to have tested whether Khara is ready to surrender or not, at least at this stage of loosing 
all paraphernalia of war. Hence he is said to have talked softly but harshly to that demon.

   Hailstones are life-taking poisonous pellets to this particular red- tailed lizard, called

   Parting with some parts of one's own accrual is
   <em>
    lobha
   </em>
   , and craving for that which is absolutely 
unavailable is
   <em>
    moha
   </em>
   . People tend to commit sin while protecting their own accruals as well 
as trying to acquire unavailable things. But any person, if goes on undertaking these evils, even after 
realizing that both are mistakes, it is an unpardonable crime. The metaphor of a red-tail-lizard is 
said to be unavailable in older scripts. There is another variation to this foot wherein the simile 
is with a Brahman bereft of his self-respect, and that foot reads as:
   <em>
    bhrSTaH pashyati duHkham sa 
braahmaNa paravaan iva

  <p class="comment">
   Again Khara may ask, 'There are many more sinners, what will become of them, why holding me alone responsible?' 
For this Rama is saying that the sinners in general will get their punishment after their mortality 
when karmic cycle is over. But those that are not only sinners but cruel, and even abhorred by world, 
will ruin here only, because their merit accumulated in earlier births has come to a standstill on this 
earth itself. Those sinners will become like petrified trees trunks, they neither fall nor their boughs 
flower.

the perpetrator of profane acts will acquire their fruits that quickly, in the world.' Eating food, 
or committing a sin is simply subjective. If one commits sin unknowingly, that will be as good as the 
intake of venomous food, unsuspectingly. Both the poisonous food, and committing sins will act internally 
and rapidly than any other ruinous inflictor. Then the sinner, or the consumer of poisonous food will 
acquire an inconsolable wretched state.

    dhvani/allusion

   : A kind of assurance is sounded here by Rama's words in saying that Khara will be absolved 
of his sins. Those that are eliminated by Rama are sure to get salvation. Here not only Khara but also 
entire army is going to get that salvation, if Khara surrenders at least at this stage. In Skanda Purana 
it is said:
   <em>
    raama vidDhaa 
nishaacaraa baaNaiH su taaDitaaH | raamam aasaadya samare saayujya padaviim gataaH || skaanda puraaNa

   But this
   <em>
    saayujua
   </em>
   , salvation or getting to heavens is of a variety. In war those that sacrifice 
themselves in the fire of arrows will get
   <em>
    indra loka
   </em>
   . Those that conduct warfare unhappily 
thinking that death is the only result of war they get
   <em>
    gandharva loka

   . Those that retreat or 
go begging for their lives and yet killed, they get
   <em>
    guhya loka

   The word

  <p class="comment">
   dhvani/allusion: Khara 'laughed at' Rama's words of self-praise means that even the Supreme Being untiringly 
does some self-praise like telling 'I am here to save you... seek refuge in me for I alone can save...' 
in order to make Himself known to the adamants. The whole concept of Bhagavad Gita in telling that 'I 
am here... Know me thus...' etc., is for the same purpose. Thus, this is a laughable situation to those 
who are already in the know of Being. Presently it is Khara who was great Vedic Brahman once, but became 
an ogre by curse. Contrariwise, it is a 'laughable talk' of the Supreme Being, to non-knowers or for 
the non-adherers.

righteous war is generally waged from morning till evening. Khara says that 'because the sun is dusking 
you humans cannot war with us, the nightwalkers who are adept in night-wars. Thus by killing you in 
nighttime does not prove my victory, for your warfare is from sunrise to sunset. Hence, this war is 
to be stalled. If you quicken now without self-extolling, I will kill you before sunset, proving my 
chivalry and then I can dab the eyes of the wives of the demons so far killed by you...'

   dhvani/allusion: The mention about Khara's mace may be noticed. In the text, its reference has come 
more often and at the end it is said to have burnt down the vegetation along its course of travel, which 
indicates that it has some radiation power. Without making it to touch the ground, Rama has splintered 
it in sky itself, and its destruction is metaphoric with a venomous serpent, and hymns and herbs can 
bring down that serpent. That is to say even if venomous missiles are used their antidotes are ready 
at hand. For this Dharmaakuutam says, without expanding:
   <em>
    anena mantra 
auShadhi balaiH viSha aadi naasha ukto bhavati | dk
   </em>
   'any poison can be neutralised by 
antidotes, say spells and nostrums...'
